# Student Performance Predictor

A simple machine learning project using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** to predict student test scores based on hours studied.

## 📋 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to use a linear regression model to predict student test scores from the number of hours they studied. It uses a small, sample dataset and visualizes the results.

## 🚀 Features

- Data handling with **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Linear regression using **scikit-learn**
- Prediction for new data
- Visualization with **Matplotlib**

## 📝 Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:

| Hours_Studied | Test_Score |
|---------------|------------|
| 5             | 50         |
| 8             | 55         |
| 10            | 60         |
| 14            | 65         |
| 12            | 98         |
| 11            | 75         |
| 1             | 80         |
| 13            | 85         |
| 15            | 90         |

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## 💻 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `python-project-using-pandas-and-numpy.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run each cell in order.

## 🔑 Key Steps

- Import libraries and prepare the data
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train a linear regression model
- Predict test scores and compare with actual values
- Predict for a new student (e.g., 8.5 hours studied)
- Visualize the regression line and data points

## 📈 Example Output

```
Actual: [85, 55]
Predicted: [77.45, 72.2]
Predicted Test Score for 8.5 hours studied: 72.72
```

A scatter plot and regression line are displayed.

## 🛠️ Customization

- Replace the sample data with your own dataset for real use.
- Tweak model parameters or try different algorithms for better accuracy.
